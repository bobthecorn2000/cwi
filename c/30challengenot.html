      <h1>Why I like My Little Pony</h1>
      <h2>Specificly Friendship is Magic</h2>
      <p>Personally I love MLP. Its overall an entertaining show, it has the added bonus of not having to worry about having kids around. Not only do I love the shows abilty to teach lessons in an entertaining format but it ends up having major plot and story. Each charector is written so that they all have flaws that they have to work through. I often will get made fun of for liking it as much as I do, but it is actually probably my favorite cartoon of all time. You actually grow attached to these charactors which makes when they suffer loses all the more painful. This however in turn makes the highs even higher. I would ask anyone to give it a shot. I think you will be plesently supprised at how fleshed out it is for a show targeted for younger kids.</p>
